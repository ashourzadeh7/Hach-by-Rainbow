# Hach-by-Rainbow
# Hacking the 4-digit PIN code using the SHA256 hash function in Python

In this project, by using the SHA256 algorithm, we want to determine what password that hash corresponds to for the given hash address. In other words, suppose a name is
given along with a hash address; As in the following example:
danial,99b057c8e3461b97f8d6c461338cf664bc84706b9cc2812daaebf210ea1b9974
We need to find out what password this hash address corresponds to. For example, in this example we will have:
danial,5104
